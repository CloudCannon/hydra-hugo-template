      <description>&lt;p&gt;The beginnings of digital marketing technology can be traced back to the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, when computers became sophisticated enough to store huge volumes of customer information. For a brief moment, no one knew what would happen in digital marketing, but by the 90&amp;rsquo;s it all became clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same &amp;ldquo;coin&amp;rdquo; or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upselling is a sales technique whereby a seller induces the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Direct selling is the marketing and selling of products directly to consumers away from a fixed retail location. Peddling is the oldest form of direct selling. Modern direct selling includes sales made through the party plan, one-on-one demonstrations, and other personal contact arrangements as well as internet sales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
